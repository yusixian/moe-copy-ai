# Quick Start extra-small AI SDK. ## What is xsAI? xsAI is a series of utils to help you use OpenAI or OpenAI-compatible API. ## Why use the xsAI? xsAI has a similar interface to the Vercel AI SDK, but smaller. This makes it ideal for a variety of scenarios that require smaller bundle size, such as web applications, cli running through npx, and so on. ### So how small is xsAI? Without further ado, let's look at the results from[Packagephobia (install size)](https://packagephobia.com) and[Bundlephobia (bundled size / gzipped size)](https://bundlephobia.com): Package size Gzipped size Bundled size Installed size xsAI reduces the installation size **40x** and the bundled size **13x**. And it could be smaller! If you only need basic text generation, you can just install the `@xsai/generate-text` package: Package size Gzipped size Bundled size Installed size ### Why are only OpenAI-compatible API supported? Considering only OpenAI-compatible APIs keeps us from being plagued by a wide range of compatibility issues while avoiding bloat. btw, Did you know that[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/openai-sdk),[Google](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai) also provides an OpenAI compatible API? We also support many more providers, which can be viewed[here](https://github.com/moeru-ai/xsai/tree/main/packages-ext/providers-cloud/src/providers). ## Join our Community If you have questions about anything related to xsAI, you're always welcome to ask our community on[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/moeru-ai/xsai/discussions).[Edit on GitHub](https://github.com/moeru-ai/xsai/blob/main/docs/content/docs/index.mdx)[Overview](/docs/packages/overview)[Next Page](/docs/packages/overview)
